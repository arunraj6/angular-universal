# Angular Universal sample application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Normal Angular Build & Serve Commands

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## SSR Commands

- `npm run dev:ssr` Similar to `ng serve`, which offers live reload during development, but uses server-side rendering.
- `npm run build:ssr` Builds both the server script and the application in production mode. Use this command when you want to build the project for deployment.
- `npm run serve:ssr` Starts the server script for serving the application locally with server-side rendering.
- `npm run prerender` Used to prerender an application's pages. The artifacts will be stored in the `dist/angular-universal/` directory.
